createRoot method:

- it create DOM (Tree) like structure.
- it create it's own DOM and compare it's DOM and User's main DOM and update only those things which updated in UI.
- U can trace DOM in virtual DOM.

\*React Fibre Architecture:

- \*key features:

  - assign to priority
  - ability to pause , abort

- fibre is well implemented.
- \*Reconcillation: - It reconsider whoch element has to update and which is not. - it is recursive algorithm. - definition: the algorithm React uses to diffrentitiate one tree with another to determine which parameter needs to be changed. - it also called "Virtual DOM".

- React uses keys to diffrentitiate the element ,keys should be "stable,predictableand unique".

\*what is fibre?

- pause work and come back to it later.
- assign priority to diffrent types of work.
- reuse previously complete work.
- abort work if it's no longer.
